# Hello world, I'm Eduardo! ðŸ‘‹ 

## About me

Since I finished my degree, I have been studying on my own in different online platforms like Platzi, Udemy and Youtube.

PHP is my favorite programming language and I love working with it and Laravel. Currently I'm learning React JS because I consider it a great skill nowadays.
